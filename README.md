Butler-Volmer Equation Demonstration

This application visualizes the Butler-Volmer equation, showing the relationship between the reaction rate (or current density) and electrode potential.

Overview

The Butler-Volmer equation describes the kinetics of electrode reactions. This application allows users to adjust parameters such as the exchange current density, temperature, number of electrons, and charge transfer coefficients. The resulting plots show both the anodic and cathodic currents, in both linear and logarithmic scales.

Features

Interactive sliders to adjust equation parameters
Visualization of the Butler-Volmer equation results in two scales:
Linear Scale
Logarithmic Scale
Display of anodic and cathodic currents as separate dotted lines
Tafel slope calculation and display
